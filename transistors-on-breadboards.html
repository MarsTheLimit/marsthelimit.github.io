                                Learning about transistors can greatly help when trying to understand the basic concept of logic gates and how they work. Similar to how learning the alphabet 
                                is the first step to understanding how words sound, learning how transistors work is essential to 
                                <a target="_blank" href="logic-gates.html">understanding how logic gates and computers work</a>. Transistors reveal the true 
                                <a target="_blank" href="boolean-logic-explained.html">Boolean logic</a> behind logic gates, as well as how voltages in a circuit produce the Boolean logic. 
                                Transistors can be a great visual way to understand logic gates. You can even build these logic gates yourself.

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                The most basic transistor circuit, making a switch with transistors, can have many uses. The way a transistor switch works is by allowing a small signal 
                                (like from a sensor) to control a larger load, like an LED or motor. A transistor has 3 pins:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                <li>Base - acts as a switch</li>
                                <li>Collector - where current flows in</li>
                                <li>Emitter - where current flows out</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                When a small current is present at the base, then the transistor turns to the “on” state, which allows the current present at the collector to flow to the emitter.
                                With no current at the base, the transistor is “off” and the current from the collector is unable to flow to the emitter.
                            </p>

                                Logic gates are simply transistors connected either in series or parallel. There can be any number of transistors in a logic gate, depending on how many inputs 
                                you want on your gate. Below are the most basic logic gates.

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                To build a NOT gate, you need 1 transistor. This gate outputs the inverse of the input. To make this gate, we can start by using the transistor switch we made
                                previously. Then, by reversing the way the LED is connected and adding a 220-ohm resistor from 5V to the emitter, we create an inverter.

                                through them and the LED, turning the LED on.

                                These gates are very similar to their inverses, the AND and OR gates. To make these gates, you would simply need to take the output of the AND or OR gate and feed it into a NOT gate to generate your NAND or NOR gate.

                                Understanding transistors is a foundational skill for anyone interested in electronics or computer systems. By learning how to build simple circuits like transistor switches and logic 
                                gates, you gain insight into how complex digital systems are constructed from basic components. These small building blocks power everything from calculators to
                                smartphones. As you continue experimenting with transistors and logic gates, you'll be well on your way to mastering the language of modern electronics. A great
                                next step is to explore deeper into computer architecture.
