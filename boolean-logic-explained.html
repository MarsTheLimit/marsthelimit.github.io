                                Whether you realize it or not, you use Boolean logic daily. By saying “I do NOT want that” or “I like this AND that,” you use Boolean expressions. Assuming you 
                                accessed this article through a digital device, you have caused your device to use Boolean logical operators in processing information to get you to where you 
                                are. Boolean logic consists of two possible values: true and false. This is why Boolean logic (and <a target="_blank" href="binary-explained.html">binary logic</a>) is considered true/false logic. For example, 
                                if someone asked you if you like ice cream, if you were using Boolean logic, you could say “yes” or “no” (yes being true and no being false). A few operators 
                                commonly used for boolean operations are NOT, AND, and OR. Let's dive into the basics of Boolean logic for beginners.
                            </p>
                            <h2 id="most-important" class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The Three Most Important Boolean Operators</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Boolean operations are the foundation of logic in digital computers and everyday decisions. Explain simply,  Boolean operations work with values that can be 
                                either true or false, also commonly represented as 1 (true) and 0 (false). The three most basic and important Boolean operations are AND, OR, and NOT.

                            </p>
                            <h3 id="and-operator" class="fw-semibold mb-4 mt-5">AND Operator</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                The AND operation checks if two or more conditions are true. If every input is true, the output will also be true. If even one of the inputs 
                                is false, the entire statement becomes false. Consider this statement:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="text-indent: 15px;"><i>If I like ice cream AND cake, then I like ice cream cake.</i></blockquote>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Both conditions, liking ice cream and liking cake, must be true for the conclusion to be true. If you like only one of the two, the statement
                                becomes false. In Boolean logic, this would look like:
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="src/and-truth-table.png" alt="truth table for the AND Boolean operator" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This table is called a truth table. The truth table for the AND operator shows that only when both A and B are 1 (true) does the output become 1.</p>
                            <h3 id="or-operator" class="fw-semibold mb-4 mt-5">OR Operator</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                The OR operation checks if at least one of the conditions is true. If either one (or both) inputs are true, the output will also be true. It only becomes 
                                false when both inputs are false. As an example:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="text-indent: 15px;"><i>If I like cookies OR brownies, then I'll be happy.</i></blockquote>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Even if you like just one of them, you'll still be happy. The only way you wouldn't be happy is if you didn't like either. Truth table for OR:
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="src/or-truth-table.png" alt="truth table for the OR Boolean operator" /></figure>
                            <h3 id="not-operator" class="fw-semibold mb-4 mt-5">NOT Operator</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                The NOT operation is a bit different—it's a unary operator, meaning it works with only one input. NOT is the smallest of the Boolean logic operators. The NOT 
                                operation simply inverts the value it receives as input. If the input is true, it outputs false. If the input is false, it outputs true.

                            </p>
                            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="text-indent: 15px;"><i>If I do not like broccoli, then I won't eat it.</i></blockquote>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Here, liking broccoli is the input. The NOT operator flips that value. If you do like it (true), the NOT turns it into false (you won't avoid it). If you don't
                                like it (false), the NOT turns it into true (you'll avoid it). The truth table for NOT is much simpler compared to AND and OR, because it has only one input:
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="src/not-truth-table.png" alt="truth table for the NOT Boolean operator" /></figure>
                            <h2 id="if-then" class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">If-Then Logic Format</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Most Boolean operations can be described using an "if-then" format. These statements form the basic logic we use in everyday decisions and programming. For 
                                example:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote class="fs-5" style="text-indent: 15px;"><i>If it's raining AND I forgot my umbrella, then I'll get wet.</i></blockquote>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                This is a Boolean condition: two truths lead to a logical consequence. In digital computers, computing with <a target="blank_" href="logic-gates.html"></a>logic gates</a>, millions of decisions are made 
                                every second, all using this Boolean format.
                            </p>
                            <h2 id="programmers" class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Boolean Logic for Programmers</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Boolean logic for programmers is very similar to the Boolean logic we use in everyday life. Boolean logic can be used in if-then statements and operations on 
                                variables in programming. The following code snippet checks if cakeLiked && (&& means and) iceCreamLiked are both true. If they are, then make iceCreamCakeLiked 
                                true as well. 
                            </p>
                            <pre class="fw-bold mb-4">if (cakeLiked && iceCreamLiked) {
    iceCreamCakeLiked = true;
}</pre>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                The "!" in front of a piece of code is the same as a NOT operator. If you wanted to change the value of a Boolean variable to its inverse, you could write
                            </p>
                            <pre class="fw-bold mb-4">x = false
x = !x</pre>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Now, after this operation, "x" equals true.
                            </p>

                                In Boolean logic, a common symbol is a line over an operator, which looks like this: W̅. This means to perform the "not" operation on the value W. So if W equals 
                                1, W̅ equals 0. This is one of the most common Boolean logic symbols in many circuit applications. Additionally, you may see a truth table that looks like this:
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="src/dont-care-state-example.png" alt="Example for the don't care state" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">All the "X" means is that when the first column is at a "0" state, then the other columns are disabled, or in the don't care state, and do not
                                matter. An example would be that the first column is the power connecting to the circuit, and when the circuit is powered off, then the other outputs will not do
                                anything. Thus, they are in the "don't care" state.
