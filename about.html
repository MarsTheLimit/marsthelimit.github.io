                                I first thought of the name “Mars the limit” when I was in third grade. I was really into comics, and I started a newspaper-type comic strip that starred a dog 
                                named Clark, a bear named Kalie, and a bunny named Clive.

                                I am a self-described scientist. I try experiments at home, ranging from circuitry and chemistry to coding. I started learning about these topics as soon as 
                                COVID-19 hit in March 2020. I was in fifth grade. Dreaming big, like many kids do, I thought that if I could learn how to code, then I could start a big phone 
                                company (like Apple) with new and better phones (as if they aren’t already optimized and engineered out the wazoo!). This dream quickly came to a halt as I began 
                                to dive into a book about the Python programming language for kids. Everything was way more complex than it had seemed. From there, I just went on the route that 
                                most interested me. I learned Python (at least to some extent), then moved on to web design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But this was still back in 2021, when 
                                I was in 7th grade. I started diving into many other languages and platforms like Unity, Java, and Blender. Then I came across Arduino. This started my 
                                electronics engineering. I got into electronics for about a couple of years. Then, during a computer science class when I was in 9th grade, I learned about logic 
                                gates. I took this ambition and decided the next best step was to build Ben Eater’s 6502 computer (it wasn’t). I built the thing, but had no idea how it worked. 
                                I started learning more and more about it until I finally understood how the computer worked. Then, in my 10th grade year, I got into Chemistry. I did various 
                                chemical experiments, but my parents quickly decided that I should stick to electronics and coding. And now here I am, in the middle of a 5-year journey, 
                                making a website for other aspiring scientists wanting to dive into the world of science.
