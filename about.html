                                This site is dedicated to young scientists, tinkerers, and creative minds who want to explore the world through hands-on science, electronics, and coding 
                                projects. Whether you're just starting out or diving deep into technical experiments, MarsTheLimit is here to inspire and guide you along the way.

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">My Journey In Science</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                I am a self-described scientist. I try experiments at home, ranging from circuitry and chemistry to coding. I started learning about these topics as soon as 
                                COVID-19 hit in March 2020. I was in fifth grade. Dreaming big, like many kids do, I thought that if I could learn how to code, then I could start a big phone 
                                company (like Apple) with new and better phones (as if they aren't already optimized and engineered out the wazoo!). This dream quickly came to a halt as I began 
                                to dive into a book about the Python programming language for kids. Everything was way more complex than it had seemed. From there, I just went on the route that 
                                most interested me. I learned Python (at least to some extent), then moved on to web design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But this was still back in 2021, when 
                                I was in 7th grade. I started diving into many other languages and platforms like Unity, Java, and Blender. Then I came across Arduino. This started my 
                                electronics engineering. I got into electronics for about a couple of years. Then, during a computer science class when I was in 9th grade, I learned about logic 
                                gates. I took this ambition and decided the next best step was to build Ben Eater's 6502 computer (it wasn't). I built the thing, but had no idea how it worked. 
                                I started learning more and more about it until I finally understood how the computer worked. Then, in my 10th grade year, I got into Chemistry. I did various 
                                chemical experiments, but my parents quickly decided that I should stick to electronics and coding. And now here I am, in the middle of a 5-year journey, 
                                making a website for other aspiring scientists wanting to dive into the world of science.

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Why I Created This Site</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                I created MarsTheLimit in hopes to help younger people discover how exciting and accessible science can be. When I first started learning about coding, 
                                electronics, and chemistry, I realized how hard it was to find clear, beginner-friendly explanations that actually made sense. This site is my way of filling 
                                that gap. A place where curious minds can explore how things work, from logic gates to chemical reactions, without needing a science degree. My goal is to break 
                                complex ideas down into simple, hands-on concepts that spark learning, creativity, and confidence in your abilities.

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Where Should I Start?</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                A great place to dive into copmuter science is to start learning about the fundamentals: <a href="/articles/boolean-logic-explained" target="_blank">Boolean logic for beginners</a>.
                                Or, if you're already faimiliar with Boolean logic, you could learn about what <a href="/articles/logic-gates" target="_blank">logic gates</a> are. We also have a page for 
                                you to <a href="/articles/" target="_blank">search through our articles</a> and find a topic that piques your interest and inspires your creativity.
